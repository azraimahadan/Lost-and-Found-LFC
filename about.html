                <h2>"Some things were better lost than found". This is one of the quotes I found while making this website. I found it very meaningful in my life. There are some things we own in this life that would be much better if they were lost. But in my opinion, something that has been lost, must be found. We have to find it no matter what. That's why we, Computer Science and Engineering students from Dongyang Mirae University made this website to help students here find things they just lost. What's the point of living if we're not helping each other? We do this for free; to help students find things they lost such as wallet, student card, shoes, umbrellas and many more. We also have our own application for Android users. All of these things were made to assist you guys. Want to find things you lost around university? Feel free to sign up!
